Moiré experiments
=================

This repo is used for experiments about `moiré effect <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern>`_. It will be a collection of test scripts, not a fancy finished software.

1_simple_initial
----------------
First tentative with naive code (WORKS)
Two linear gratings with different frequency create a 3rd linear frequency

2_round
-------
Not expected but interesting result
Two almost linear gratings create circular pattern

3_cross_circle
--------------
Circular grating with a cross emerging pattern
Result of try and errors with equations

4_spiral
--------
Circular gratings with spiral emerging pattern
Result of try and errors with equations
